## Your Task

**CRITICAL: IMMEDIATELY DEPLOY 8 PARALLEL REFLECTION AGENTS** for instant comprehensive analysis. Each agent operates independently for maximum efficiency.

**Expected speedup: 6-8x faster than sequential reflection analysis.**

STEP 1: Initialize parallel reflection session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/reflection-session-$SESSION_ID.json`
- **LAUNCH ALL 8 REFLECTION AGENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY:**

[Deploy all agents in single response - NO SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION]

**Agent 1 - Success Pattern Analyzer**: "Analyze all successful implementations, high-velocity periods, and positive outcomes from git history. Identify what worked well, breakthrough moments, and effective patterns. Extract specific examples from commits, PRs, and resolved issues."

**Agent 2 - Challenge & Bottleneck Investigator**: "Investigate technical debt, failed attempts, reverted commits, and workflow bottlenecks. Analyze unresolved issues, delayed PRs, and communication gaps. Find root causes and patterns in challenges."

**Agent 3 - Learning & Insight Extractor**: "Extract key learnings from code evolution, architectural decisions, and domain knowledge expansion. Correlate decisions with outcomes. Identify skill development patterns and knowledge gained."

**Agent 4 - Quantitative Metrics Analyzer**: "Calculate all quantitative metrics: development velocity, code quality trends, PR turnaround times, issue resolution patterns, test coverage changes, and collaboration health indicators."

**Agent 5 - Decision Impact Assessor**: "Review all major decisions from commit messages and PR discussions. Assess outcomes against objectives, analyze trade-offs made, and evaluate alternative paths not taken."

**Agent 6 - Team Collaboration Auditor**: "Analyze collaboration patterns, review quality, contributor diversity, communication effectiveness, and team dynamics evolution. Identify collaboration highlights and gaps."

**Agent 7 - Technical Achievement Scanner**: "Scan for technical milestones, architectural improvements, performance optimizations, security enhancements, and code quality improvements. Document specific achievements with evidence."

**Agent 8 - Future Improvement Generator**: "Based on all available data, generate actionable improvements prioritized by impact. Create SMART goals, design process experiments, and plan technical debt reduction strategies."

**CRITICAL**: All agents must execute in parallel. NO waiting between agent launches. This achieves 6-8x speedup over sequential analysis.

STEP 2: Synthesize parallel agent findings

**AWAIT all 8 agents to complete their parallel analysis**

- COLLECT findings from all reflection agents
- MERGE quantitative metrics from Agent 4
- SYNTHESIZE success patterns from Agent 1 with challenges from Agent 2
- CORRELATE decisions (Agent 5) with outcomes and learnings (Agent 3)
- COMBINE technical achievements (Agent 7) with collaboration patterns (Agent 6)
- INTEGRATE improvement recommendations from Agent 8

**Session State Management:**

```json
{
  "session_id": "$SESSION_ID",
  "parallel_agents": {
    "success_patterns": "completed",
    "challenges": "completed",
    "learnings": "completed",
    "metrics": "completed",
    "decisions": "completed",
    "collaboration": "completed",
    "achievements": "completed",
    "improvements": "completed"
  },
  "synthesis_state": "merging_insights",
  "performance_metrics": {
    "total_time": "8-12 seconds",
    "speedup": "6-8x",
    "agents_deployed": 8
  }
}
```

STEP 3: Generate ultra-comprehensive retrospective analysis

**Parallel Processing Benefits:**

- **Traditional Sequential Reflection**: 60-80 seconds for comprehensive analysis
- **Parallel Agent Reflection**: 8-12 seconds with 8 concurrent agents
- **Quality Enhancement**: More thorough coverage through specialized agents
- **Consistency**: Each agent follows structured analysis patterns
- **Scalability**: Can analyze larger codebases and longer timeframes

**Reflection Analysis Framework (Synthesized from all agents):**

FOR EACH reflection dimension:

**1. Context Establishment (Merged from all agents)**

```json
{
  "period_scope": "$ARGUMENTS or current session",
  "key_objectives": "extracted from git commits and PR descriptions",
  "stakeholders": "identified from git contributors and PR reviewers",
  "data_sources": ["git_history", "github_activity", "code_metrics", "test_results"]
}
```

**2. Success Pattern Recognition (Synthesized from Agent 1 & 7)**

- Successful implementations identified by Success Pattern Analyzer
- High-velocity periods and breakthrough moments from parallel analysis
- Effective collaboration patterns from Team Collaboration Auditor
- Technical achievements documented by Achievement Scanner

- Communication gaps identified by Collaboration Auditor

**4. Learning Extraction (Synthesized from Agent 3 & 5)**

- Decision-outcome correlations from parallel analysis
- Architectural lessons extracted by Learning Extractor
- Skill development patterns identified across multiple dimensions
- Domain knowledge expansion documented systematically
- Process discoveries from cross-agent insights

**5. Decision Impact Assessment (Primary: Agent 5, Enhanced by Agent 3)**

- Outcomes measured against objectives with quantitative backing
- Alternative paths analyzed with parallel perspective
- Trade-offs assessed with multi-dimensional view
