---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Target project: $ARGUMENTS
- Project structure: !`fd . -t d -d 3 | head -10 || echo "No directories found"`
- Build system detection: !`fd "(deno\.json|package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml|build\.gradle)" . -d 3 | head -5 || echo "No build files detected"`
- Documentation exists: !`fd "(README|ARCHITECTURE|DESIGN|DOCS)" . -t f -d 2 | head -3 || echo "No docs found"`
- Code languages: !`fd "\.(rs|go|java|ts|js|py|rb)$" . | head -5 | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' ' || echo "No code files"`
- Repository size: !`eza -la . | head -3 || ls -la . | head -3`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize knowledge extraction session with state management

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json`
- INITIALIZE extraction scope and project boundaries
- DETERMINE primary technology stacks and architectural complexity
- ASSESS existing documentation completeness and quality gaps

```bash
echo '{' > /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "sessionId": "'$SESSION_ID'",' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "timestamp": "'$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)'",' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "project": "'$ARGUMENTS'",' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "phase": "initialization",' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "completed_phases": [],' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "discovered_domains": [],' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "architectural_patterns": [],' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '  "knowledge_artifacts": []' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
echo '}' >> /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
```

STEP 2: Parallel domain discovery using strategic sub-agent delegation

TRY:

- LAUNCH 8 parallel sub-agents for comprehensive codebase analysis
- EACH sub-agent focuses on specific architectural aspect
- COORDINATE findings through session state management
- SYNTHESIZE results for architectural understanding

**Parallel Sub-Agent Knowledge Extraction:**

LAUNCH parallel sub-agents for simultaneous domain analysis:

- **Agent 1: Domain Model Discovery**: Analyze core business entities, data models, and domain types
  - Focus: struct/class/interface definitions, enums, data transfer objects
  - Extract: Business terminology, entity relationships, data constraints
  - Save findings: Domain entities, business rules, validation logic

- **Agent 2: Service Architecture Analysis**: Map service layers, handlers, and business logic patterns
  - Focus: Service implementations, controllers, handlers, repositories
  - Extract: Service boundaries, dependency patterns, integration points
  - Save findings: Service interfaces, business workflows, architectural layers

- **Agent 3: API & Interface Documentation**: Discover all external and internal APIs
  - Focus: REST endpoints, RPC services, GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs
  - Extract: API contracts, request/response patterns, authentication flows
  - Save findings: Endpoint inventory, API documentation, integration guides

- **Agent 4: Data Architecture Mapping**: Analyze database schemas, migrations, and data flow
  - Focus: Migration files, ORM models, SQL queries, data transformations
  - Extract: Schema evolution, data relationships, query patterns
  - Save findings: Database design, data flow diagrams, migration strategies

- **Agent 5: Business Logic & Workflow Analysis**: Identify state machines, business rules, and processes
  - Focus: State management, workflow engines, business calculations, validation rules
  - Extract: Business processes, state transitions, rule engines
  - Save findings: Workflow documentation, business rule catalog, process maps

- **Agent 6: Configuration & Infrastructure Discovery**: Map deployment, configuration, and operational patterns
  - Focus: Config files, environment variables, deployment manifests, infrastructure as code
  - Extract: Deployment patterns, configuration management, operational procedures
  - Save findings: Deployment guides, configuration documentation, operational runbooks

- **Agent 7: Error Handling & Monitoring Analysis**: Document error patterns, logging, and observability
  - Focus: Error definitions, logging patterns, metrics, monitoring, alerting
  - Extract: Error handling strategies, observability patterns, debugging guides
  - Save findings: Error catalogs, monitoring documentation, troubleshooting guides

- **Agent 8: Testing & Quality Patterns**: Analyze testing strategies, coverage, and quality patterns
  - Focus: Test structure, mock patterns, integration tests, quality gates
  - Extract: Testing methodologies, quality standards, coverage patterns
  - Save findings: Testing guides, quality documentation, best practices

**Sub-Agent Coordination Protocol:**

- Each sub-agent executes independently using Task tool
- Results saved to session state under respective domains
- Parallel execution provides 6-8x performance improvement
- Failed agents report gracefully without blocking others
- Main agent synthesizes findings across all domains

CATCH (analysis_failed):

- LOG error details to session state
- CONTINUE with available analysis results
- DOCUMENT gaps and limitations in final report

STEP 3: Architectural synthesis and pattern identification

TRY:

- AGGREGATE findings from all sub-agents
- IDENTIFY cross-cutting architectural patterns
- MAP domain relationships and dependencies
- EXTRACT recurring design patterns and conventions
- SYNTHESIZE into coherent architectural understanding

**Pattern Recognition Process:**

FOR EACH architectural aspect:

```bash
# Cross-cutting pattern analysis
echo "Identifying recurring architectural patterns..."

# Service layer patterns
pattern_count=$(rg "Service|Handler|Controller|Repository" . | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Service layer implementations: $pattern_count"

# Domain modeling patterns  
entity_count=$(rg "struct|class|interface|enum" --type rust --type go --type java --type ts | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Domain entities discovered: $entity_count"

# Error handling patterns
error_count=$(rg "Error|Exception|Result|Option" --type rust --type go --type java --type ts | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Error handling patterns: $error_count"

# Update session state with pattern metrics
jq '.architectural_patterns += [{
  "serviceLayerCount": '$pattern_count',
  "domainEntityCount": '$entity_count',
  "errorHandlingCount": '$error_count',
  "timestamp": "'$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)'"
}]' /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/temp-state.json
mv /tmp/temp-state.json /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
```

**Architectural Understanding Development:**

- ANALYZE service decomposition and modularity patterns
- IDENTIFY data flow and integration architectures
- MAP component dependencies and coupling patterns
- EXTRACT configuration and deployment strategies
- DOCUMENT security and authentication patterns

STEP 4: Knowledge artifact generation with structured documentation

TRY:

- SYNTHESIZE all sub-agent findings into comprehensive documentation
- CREATE structured knowledge artifacts for different audiences
- GENERATE actionable documentation with examples and usage patterns
- ESTABLISH knowledge maintenance and update processes

**Knowledge Artifact Creation Workflow:**

FOR EACH documentation artifact:

```bash
echo "Generating comprehensive knowledge documentation..."

# Create documentation directory structure
mkdir -p docs/extracted-knowledge/{architecture,domain,api,deployment,testing}

# Generate timestamp for artifact tracking
doc_timestamp=$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)

# Update session state with artifact generation
jq '.phase = "artifact_generation" | .knowledge_artifacts += [{
  "type": "documentation_suite",
  "timestamp": "'$doc_timestamp'",
  "location": "docs/extracted-knowledge/",
  "status": "generating"
}]' /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/temp-state.json
mv /tmp/temp-state.json /tmp/knowledge-extract-state-$SESSION_ID.json
