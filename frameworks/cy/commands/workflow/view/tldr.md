description: Generate concise, actionable TL;DR summaries with progressive disclosure and strategic thinking
---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N 2>/dev/null || date +%s%N 2>/dev/null || echo "$(date +%s)$(jot -r 1 100000 999999 2>/dev/null || shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1 2>/dev/null || echo $RANDOM$RANDOM)"`
- Target content: $ARGUMENTS
- Content type: !`if [ -f "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then echo "file" && eza -la "$ARGUMENTS" 2>/dev/null | head -1; elif [ -d "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then echo "directory" && eza -la "$ARGUMENTS" 2>/dev/null | head -3; else echo "topic/discussion"; fi`
- Content size: !`if [ -f "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then wc -l "$ARGUMENTS" 2>/dev/null | head -1; elif [ -d "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then fd . "$ARGUMENTS" -t f | wc -l 2>/dev/null; else echo "unknown"; fi`
- File preview: !`if [ -f "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then head -10 "$ARGUMENTS" 2>/dev/null | bat --style=plain -l markdown; else echo "Not a file"; fi`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize TL;DR session with intelligent content analysis

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.json`
- ANALYZE content type and complexity from Context section
- DETERMINE optimal TL;DR strategy based on content characteristics
- PLAN progressive disclosure levels (30-second, 2-minute, 5-minute)

```bash
# Initialize TL;DR session state
echo '{
  "sessionId": "'$SESSION_ID'",
  "targetContent": "'$ARGUMENTS'",
  "contentType": "unknown",
  "analysisStrategy": "auto-detect",
  "progressiveDisclosure": true
}' > /tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.json
```

STEP 2: Content analysis and strategy selection

IF content_type == "file":

- READ file content to understand structure and key points
- IDENTIFY document type (code, documentation, configuration, etc.)
- EXTRACT key sections, headings, and critical information
- DETERMINE technical vs. business audience focus

ELSE IF content_type == "directory":

- ANALYZE project structure and file organization
- IDENTIFY technology stack and architecture patterns
- FIND key configuration files and documentation
- DETERMINE project complexity and scope

ELSE IF content_type == "topic/discussion":

- THINK HARD about the topic to identify core concepts
- RESEARCH key aspects and common questions
- STRUCTURE information hierarchy from critical to contextual
- FOCUS on actionable insights and next steps

STEP 3: Generate progressive disclosure TL;DR with strategic thinking

STEP 4: Apply context-specific TL;DR formatting

FOR content_type:

**Technical/Code Content:**

```markdown
# TL;DR: [Component/System]

## What It Does

[One sentence description of purpose]

## Key Components

- [Main module/service]: [What it handles]
- [Secondary component]: [Its role]

1. [Setup/installation step]
2. [Configuration requirement]
3. [First thing to run/test]

## Common Issues

- [Most frequent problem and fix]
- [Performance consideration]

## Who to Ask

- [Subject matter expert]
- [Documentation location]
```

**Documentation Content:**

```markdown

## Main Message

[Core thesis or argument in one sentence]

## Key Takeaways

- [Most important insight]
- [Critical fact or data point]
- [Actionable recommendation]

## Implementation

1. [First step to apply this knowledge]
2. [How to measure success]

## Skip This If

- [When this doesn't apply]
- [Prerequisites not met]
```

**Project/Feature Content:**

```markdown
# TL;DR: [Project Name]

## Goal

[What we're trying to achieve]

```

STEP 5: Quality validation and optimization

- VERIFY TL;DR can be read in under specified time limits
- ENSURE each section includes concrete next steps
- HIGHLIGHT biggest risks and critical concerns
- PROVIDE contact info or resource references
- USE bullet points and short sentences consistently

STEP 6: Generate final TL;DR with session summary

- UPDATE session state with completion status
- PROVIDE TL;DR following chosen format
- INCLUDE meta-information about analysis process
- CLEAN UP temporary session files

```bash
# Update session completion
jq --arg status "completed" --arg timestamp "$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)" '
  .status = $status |
  .completed_timestamp = $timestamp |
  .analysis_method = "progressive_disclosure"
' /tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.tmp && \
mv /tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/tldr-session-$SESSION_ID.json
```

FINALLY:

- PRESENT TL;DR using appropriate format for content type
- INCLUDE progressive disclosure sections (30s/2min/5min)
- PROVIDE meta-commentary on TL;DR creation process if helpful
- SUGGEST integration with other workflow commands if relevant

# /tldr

Generate concise, actionable summaries of complex topics, documentation, codebases, or discussions. Focus on essential information and immediate next steps.

## Usage

```
/tldr [topic, document, codebase, or discussion]
```

## Summary Framework

### Key Principles

- **Brevity**: Maximum 5 bullet points per section
- **Actionability**: Focus on what to do, not just what to know
- **Hierarchy**: Most important information first
- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language
- **Context**: Include just enough background for understanding

## Examples by Use Case

### Codebase Analysis TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Payment Service

## What It Does

Processes credit card payments through Stripe with retry logic and fraud detection.

## Key Files

- `payment_processor.rs`: Main business logic
- `stripe_client.rs`: External API integration
- `fraud_detector.rs`: Risk assessment rules

## To Debug Issues

1. Check logs in `/var/log/payments/`
2. Verify Stripe webhook status
3. Look for fraud blocks in dashboard

## Critical Dependencies

- Stripe API (payment processing)
- Redis (rate limiting)
- Postgres (transaction history)

## Contact: Sarah Chen (payment-team@company.com)
```

### Architecture Decision TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Database Choice - ScyllaDB

## Decision

Migrate from Postgres to ScyllaDB for event storage.

## Why

- 10x better write performance at scale
- Native time-series support
- Compatible with Cassandra tools

## Next Steps

1. Proof of concept by Jan 15
2. Migration plan by Feb 1
3. Production rollout Q2

## Risks

- Team learning curve (2-3 weeks)
- Data migration complexity
- Operational tooling gaps

## Resources

- ScyllaDB docs: [link]
- POC repository: [link]
- Migration champion: Alex Kim
```

### Bug Investigation TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Login Timeout Bug

## Problem

Users getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes.

## Root Cause

JWT expiration misconfigured in auth service config.

## Fix Applied

Changed `token_expiry` from 300s to 1800s in `auth.yaml`

## Prevention

- Added integration test for token expiry
- Documented config in runbook
- Set up monitoring alert for short sessions

## Status: RESOLVED (deployed to prod 2024-01-15)
```

### Research Summary TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: State Management Options

## Recommendation

Use Zustand for client state, React Query for server state.

## Why

- Simpler than Redux (less boilerplate)
- Better TypeScript support
- Proven at scale (used by Vercel, etc.)

## Implementation

1. Replace Redux store with Zustand (1 week)
2. Add React Query for API calls (1 week)
3. Remove unnecessary middleware (2 days)

## Tradeoffs

- ‚úÖ Faster development, fewer bugs
- ‚ùå Team relearning curve
- ‚ùå Less ecosystem/tooling than Redux
```
