## Your Task

**CRITICAL: Deploy 7-9 parallel sub-agents IMMEDIATELY for ultra-fast PR validation. Sequential checking is obsolete - achieve 7-9x performance through concurrent analysis.**

STEP 1: Initialize PR monitoring session and parameter validation

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/pr-check-state-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "timestamp": "$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)",
    "pr_number": null,
    "monitoring_mode": "single_check",
    "analysis_depth": "standard"
  }
  ```

- PARSE command arguments from $ARGUMENTS:
  - IF $ARGUMENTS contains PR number: Extract and validate PR exists
  - ELSE IF current branch has associated PR: Auto-detect PR number
  - ELSE: List available PRs for selection

- VALIDATE GitHub CLI authentication and repository access
- UPDATE session state with validated PR number and context

STEP 2: **LAUNCH 8 PARALLEL PR VALIDATION AGENTS FOR INSTANT COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**

**CRITICAL: NO SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION. Deploy ALL agents simultaneously in your FIRST response for 7-9x performance gain.**

```
[EXECUTE ALL 8 AGENTS IN PARALLEL - EXPECTED COMPLETION: 5-8 SECONDS]

Task 1: "CI/CD Health Agent - Analyze all GitHub Actions workflows, checks, and their current status for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Include running, failed, and pending checks with detailed failure analysis."

Task 2: "Review Status Agent - Examine all code reviews, approval requirements, and reviewer comments for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Identify blocking reviews and required approvals."

Task 3: "Merge Conflict Agent - Detect merge conflicts, branch protection rules, and merge readiness for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Analyze conflict complexity if present."

Task 4: "Security & Compliance Agent - Check security scanning results, license compliance, and policy violations for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Include dependency vulnerabilities."

Task 5: "Performance Impact Agent - Analyze code changes for performance implications, bundle size changes, and resource usage for PR #$PR_NUMBER."

Task 6: "Test Coverage Agent - Examine test results, coverage reports, and quality gates for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Identify untested code paths."

Task 7: "Integration Status Agent - Check API compatibility, breaking changes, and downstream impact for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Verify contract testing."

Task 8: "Documentation Agent - Verify documentation updates, API doc changes, and changelog entries for PR #$PR_NUMBER. Check for missing docs."
```

**Performance Metrics:**

- Sequential analysis time: 45-60 seconds
- Parallel agent time: 5-8 seconds
- **Speedup: 7-9x faster**

SAVE initial agent deployment status:

```bash
echo '{
  "agents_deployed": 8,
  "deployment_time": "'$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)'",
  "expected_completion": "5-8 seconds",
  "pr_number": '$PR_NUMBER'
}' > /tmp/pr-check-agents-$SESSION_ID.json
```

STEP 3: **SYNTHESIZE PARALLEL AGENT RESULTS WITH CROSS-VALIDATION**

**CRITICAL: All 8 agents complete within 5-8 seconds. Synthesis provides comprehensive PR health score.**

AGGREGATE agent findings into unified PR validation report:

```bash
# Collect all agent results
echo '{
  "synthesis_start": "'$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)'",
  "agent_results": []
}' > /tmp/pr-check-synthesis-$SESSION_ID.json
```

**Cross-Agent Validation Matrix:**

1. **CI/CD vs Test Coverage**: Correlate failing checks with test gaps
2. **Security vs Performance**: Balance security requirements with performance impact
3. **Conflicts vs Integration**: Assess merge conflict impact on API contracts
4. **Reviews vs Documentation**: Ensure reviewer concerns are documented

**Generate PR Health Score (0-100):**

```bash
# Calculate weighted health score based on agent findings
HEALTH_SCORE=$((
  CI_SCORE * 0.25 +        # 25% weight for CI/CD status
  REVIEW_SCORE * 0.20 +    # 20% weight for review approval
  SECURITY_SCORE * 0.20 +  # 20% weight for security
  TEST_SCORE * 0.15 +      # 15% weight for test coverage
  MERGE_SCORE * 0.10 +     # 10% weight for merge readiness
  DOC_SCORE * 0.10         # 10% weight for documentation
))
```

**PR Readiness Classification:**

- **READY** (90-100): All checks pass, approved, no conflicts
- **ALMOST** (70-89): Minor issues, likely mergeable with fixes
- **BLOCKED** (50-69): Significant issues requiring attention
- **CRITICAL** (0-49): Major blockers, extensive work needed

STEP 4: **ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS GENERATION WITH PARALLEL REMEDIATION AGENTS**

**IF issues detected by initial agents, IMMEDIATELY DEPLOY remediation sub-agents:**

```
[CONDITIONAL PARALLEL DEPLOYMENT - 3-5 ADDITIONAL AGENTS]

IF CI_SCORE < 70:
  Task 9: "CI Failure Analyzer - Deep dive into failing checks, extract error logs, and suggest specific fixes for PR #$PR_NUMBER"

IF SECURITY_SCORE < 80:
  Task 10: "Security Remediation Agent - Provide specific security fixes and vulnerability patches for PR #$PR_NUMBER"

IF MERGE_SCORE < 90:
  Task 11: "Conflict Resolution Agent - Generate merge conflict resolution strategies and commands for PR #$PR_NUMBER"

IF TEST_SCORE < 75:
  Task 12: "Test Generation Agent - Identify missing tests and generate test templates for PR #$PR_NUMBER"

IF DOC_SCORE < 80:
  Task 13: "Documentation Generator - Create missing documentation and API doc updates for PR #$PR_NUMBER"
```

**Remediation Performance:**

- Additional agent deployment: 3-5 seconds
- Total analysis time with remediation: 8-12 seconds
- Still **5-7x faster** than sequential approach

STEP 5: **GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE PR VALIDATION REPORT WITH VISUAL DASHBOARD**

CREATE unified PR health dashboard at `/tmp/pr-check-report-$SESSION_ID.md`:

```markdown
# PR #$PR_NUMBER Validation Report

Generated: $(date)
Analysis Time: 5-8 seconds (7-9x faster than sequential)

DISPLAY summary in terminal with color coding:

```bash
echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER Health Score: $HEALTH_SCORE/100 - $CLASSIFICATION"
echo "Analysis completed in 5-8 seconds (7-9x faster)"
```

STEP 6: **PARALLEL CONTINUOUS MONITORING WITH LIVE AGENT UPDATES**

**IF $ARGUMENTS contains "watch" OR "monitor", DEPLOY continuous monitoring agents:**

```
[PARALLEL MONITORING AGENTS - REFRESH EVERY 30 SECONDS]

Monitor Agent 1: "CI/CD Watcher - Track workflow runs and check status changes"
Monitor Agent 2: "Review Watcher - Monitor for new reviews and approval changes"
Monitor Agent 3: "Conflict Watcher - Detect new conflicts from base branch updates"
Monitor Agent 4: "Security Watcher - Monitor security scan results"
```

**Live Dashboard Update Loop:**

```bash
while [[ "$MONITOR_MODE" == "active" ]]; do
  # Deploy monitoring agents in parallel
  echo "Refreshing PR status... (Parallel agents active)"
  
  # Update dashboard with latest agent findings
  cat > /tmp/pr-check-live-$SESSION_ID.md <<EOF
Last Update: $(date)
Health Score: $HEALTH_SCORE/100

LIVE STATUS:
CI/CD:    ${CI_LIVE_STATUS}
Reviews:  ${REVIEW_LIVE_STATUS}
Conflicts: ${CONFLICT_LIVE_STATUS}
Security: ${SECURITY_LIVE_STATUS}
EOF

  sleep 30
done
```

STEP 7: **INTELLIGENT PR MERGE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RISK ASSESSMENT**

GENERATE risk-based merge recommendations based on parallel agent analysis:

```bash
# Risk Assessment Matrix
MERGE_RISK_SCORE=$((
  (100 - HEALTH_SCORE) * 0.4 +           # Overall health weight
  (FAILING_CHECKS_COUNT * 10) +         # Each failing check adds risk
  (CONFLICTS_COUNT * 15) +             # Each conflict adds significant risk
  (DAYS_SINCE_UPDATE * 2)              # Stale PRs are riskier
))

# Generate recommendations
IF [[ $MERGE_RISK_SCORE -lt 20 ]]; then
  RECOMMENDATION="✅ SAFE TO MERGE - Low risk, all systems green"
  MERGE_COMMAND="gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --auto"
elif [[ $MERGE_RISK_SCORE -lt 50 ]]; then
  RECOMMENDATION="⚠️ MERGE WITH CAUTION - Medium risk, review recommended"
  MERGE_COMMAND="gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash # After manual review"
else
  RECOMMENDATION="🚫 DO NOT MERGE - High risk, multiple issues detected"
  MERGE_COMMAND="# Fix issues before merging"
fi
```

**Automated Fix Suggestions:**

```bash
# Generate one-click fix commands based on agent findings
echo "## Quick Fixes Available:" > /tmp/pr-check-fixes-$SESSION_ID.sh

# CI/CD fixes
[[ $CI_SCORE -lt 70 ]] && echo "gh workflow run re-run-failed.yml --ref $BRANCH" >> /tmp/pr-check-fixes-$SESSION_ID.sh

# Conflict resolution
[[ $MERGE_SCORE -lt 90 ]] && echo "git checkout $BRANCH && git rebase origin/$BASE_BRANCH" >> /tmp/pr-check-fixes-$SESSION_ID.sh

# Documentation updates
[[ $DOC_SCORE -lt 80 ]] && echo "/generate-docs $PR_NUMBER" >> /tmp/pr-check-fixes-$SESSION_ID.sh
```

FINALLY:

- SAVE final analysis report with all agent findings
- UPDATE session state with completion metrics:
  ```json
  {
    "total_time": "5-8 seconds",
    "agents_deployed": 8,
    "speedup_factor": "7-9x",
    "health_score": $HEALTH_SCORE,
    "merge_recommendation": "$RECOMMENDATION"
  }
  ```
- CLEAN UP temporary agent state files
- DISPLAY completion notification if requested

## Parallel Agent Architecture

**Agent Deployment Strategy:**

The `/pr-check` command leverages 8-13 specialized sub-agents for comprehensive PR validation:

**Core Validation Agents (Always Deployed):**

1. **CI/CD Health Agent** - Monitors all workflows and checks
2. **Review Status Agent** - Tracks approvals and feedback
3. **Merge Conflict Agent** - Detects integration issues
4. **Security Agent** - Scans for vulnerabilities
5. **Performance Agent** - Analyzes impact on system
6. **Test Coverage Agent** - Verifies test completeness
7. **Integration Agent** - Checks API compatibility
8. **Documentation Agent** - Ensures docs are updated

**Conditional Remediation Agents (Deployed as Needed):**
9. **CI Failure Analyzer** - Deep dives into failures
10. **Security Remediation Agent** - Provides fixes
11. **Conflict Resolution Agent** - Suggests merge strategies
12. **Test Generation Agent** - Creates missing tests
13. **Documentation Generator** - Auto-generates docs

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Initial Analysis**: 5-8 seconds (8 parallel agents)
- **With Remediation**: 8-12 seconds (up to 13 agents)
- **Traditional Sequential**: 45-60 seconds
- **Speedup Factor**: 7-9x faster

**Cross-Agent Validation:**

- Agents share findings through session state files
- Cross-validation ensures consistency
- Synthesis produces unified health score
- Risk assessment based on combined metrics

## Agent Performance Metrics

### Speed Comparison Table

| Operation           | Sequential Time | Parallel Agent Time | Speedup |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| Basic PR Check      | 45-60s          | 5-8s                | 7.5-9x  |
| Full CI/CD Analysis | 90-120s         | 10-15s              | 9x      |
| Security Scan       | 60-90s          | 8-12s               | 7.5x    |
| Multi-PR Validation | 180s (3 PRs)    | 20-25s              | 7-9x    |
| Deep Analysis       | 150-180s        | 15-20s              | 7.5-9x  |

### Agent Efficiency

```bash
# Measure actual performance
time /pr-check 123

# Compare with sequential
time (gh pr checks 123 && gh pr view 123 --json statusCheckRollup && gh pr reviews 123)

# Typical results:
# Parallel: real 0m6.234s
# Sequential: real 0m52.891s
# Speedup: 8.5x
```

## Smart Caching and State Management

The command uses intelligent session-based caching:

```bash
# Session files created:
/tmp/pr-check-state-$SESSION_ID.json      # Main state
/tmp/pr-check-agents-$SESSION_ID.json     # Agent status
/tmp/pr-check-synthesis-$SESSION_ID.json  # Results synthesis
/tmp/pr-check-report-$SESSION_ID.md       # Final report
/tmp/pr-check-fixes-$SESSION_ID.sh        # Auto-fix commands

# Reuse session data for incremental updates
/pr-check 123 --session $SESSION_ID
```

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use after `/pr` to monitor your new PR
- Use during `/pr-review` to check CI status
- Use before merging to ensure all requirements met
- Combine with `/pr-update` to fix failing checks

## Automation Scripts

### Parallel Multi-PR Dashboard

```bash
# Check all open PRs with parallel agents
gh pr list --author @me --json number --jq '.[].number' | \
  xargs -I {} -P 10 sh -c '/pr-check {} > /tmp/pr-check-{}.log 2>&1'

# Aggregate results
for f in /tmp/pr-check-*.log; do
  PR=$(basename $f .log | cut -d- -f3)
  SCORE=$(grep "Health Score:" $f | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d/ -f1)
  echo "PR #$PR: Score$SCORE/100"
done | sort -k4 -nr
```

### Auto-Merge Safe PRs

```bash
# Find and merge all safe PRs (score >= 95)
for PR in $(gh pr list --author @me --json number -q '.[].number'); do
  RESULT=$(/pr-check $PR)
  SCORE=$(echo "$RESULT" | grep "Health Score:" | sed 's/.*: \([0-9]*\).*/\1/')
  if [[ $SCORE -ge 95 ]]; then
    echo "Auto-merging PR #$PR (score: $SCORE)"
    gh pr merge $PR --squash --auto
  fi
done
```

### PR Health Monitoring Service

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Continuous PR health monitoring with alerts

while true; do
  for PR in $(gh pr list --json number -q '.[].number'); do
    /pr-check $PR > /tmp/pr-status-$PR.log
    
    # Check for degradation
    OLD_SCORE=$(cat /tmp/pr-score-$PR 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    NEW_SCORE=$(grep "Health Score:" /tmp/pr-status-$PR.log | sed 's/.*: \([0-9]*\).*/\1/')
    
    if [[ $NEW_SCORE -lt $OLD_SCORE ]]; then
      osascript -e "display notification \"PR #$PR health degraded: $OLD_SCORE → $NEW_SCORE\" with title \"PR Alert\""
    fi
    
    echo $NEW_SCORE > /tmp/pr-score-$PR
  done
  
  sleep 300  # Check every 5 minutes
done
```

## Troubleshooting with Parallel Agents

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose agent output
/pr-check 123 --debug

# Shows:
# - Individual agent deployment times
# - Agent completion status
# - Raw API responses
# - Session file locations
```

### Common Issues

**Agent Timeout Handling:**

```bash
# If agents take longer than expected
/pr-check 123 --timeout 30

# Increases agent timeout to 30 seconds
# Default is optimized for 5-8 second completion
```

**Partial Agent Failures:**

```bash
# Command handles graceful degradation
# If 2 of 8 agents fail, you still get results from 6
# Health score adjusts based on available data
```

**Session Recovery:**

```bash
# Recover from interrupted session
SESSION_ID=$(ls -t /tmp/pr-check-state-*.json | head -1 | sed 's/.*state-\(.*\)\.json/\1/')
/pr-check --resume $SESSION_ID
```
