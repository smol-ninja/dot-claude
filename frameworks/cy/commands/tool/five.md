description: Apply five whys root cause analysis to a problem

## Context

- Problem description: $ARGUMENTS

## Your task

Apply the Five Whys root cause analysis technique to understand the underlying cause of the problem:

1. **State the Problem** - Clearly define the issue from the arguments
2. **Ask "Why?" Iteratively** - Ask why this problem occurs, then why that cause occurs, continuing 5 times
3. **Identify Root Cause** - Determine the fundamental cause at the end of the chain
4. **Suggest Solutions** - Propose actions to address the root cause
5. **Prevent Recurrence** - Recommend systemic improvements to prevent the issue

**Five Whys Process:**

- **Problem**: [State the initial problem]
- **Why 1**: Why does this problem occur?
- **Why 2**: Why does that cause occur?
- **Why 3**: Why does that deeper cause occur?
- **Why 4**: Why does that even deeper cause occur?
- **Why 5**: Why does that fundamental cause occur?

**Root Cause**: The final answer should reveal the systemic issue

Use sequential thinking to work through each "why" systematically and identify the true root cause rather than surface-level symptoms.
