- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "No git repository"`

## Usage

```
/investigate [topic or question]
```

## Your Task

STEP 1: Investigation Setup and Context Analysis

- Create session state file: /tmp/investigate-state-$SESSION_ID.json
- Parse investigation topic: $ARGUMENTS
- Identify key terms and concepts from the investigation target
- Determine investigation scope and depth requirements
- Save initial context to state file

STEP 2: Codebase Discovery (Parallel Sub-Agent Approach)

FOR complex investigations requiring extensive codebase analysis:

**CRITICAL: Deploy parallel sub-agents for comprehensive investigation (7-9x faster research)**

IMMEDIATELY launch 8 specialized investigation agents:

- **Agent 1: Implementation Pattern Analysis**: Search for existing implementations and architectural patterns
  - Focus: Current implementations, design patterns, code structure, architecture decisions
  - Tools: Code pattern analysis, architecture mapping, implementation discovery
  - Output: Existing solution catalog with pattern assessment and architectural insights

- **Agent 2: Configuration & Dependencies Analysis**: Analyze configuration files and dependency ecosystem
  - Focus: Configuration files, dependency versions, environment settings, build configurations
  - Tools: Configuration analysis, dependency tree analysis, version compatibility checking
  - Output: Configuration landscape with dependency analysis and compatibility assessment

- **Agent 3: Documentation & Knowledge Analysis**: Review documentation and architectural decisions
  - Focus: READMEs, architectural docs, decision records, inline documentation
  - Tools: Documentation analysis, knowledge extraction, decision tracking
  - Output: Knowledge baseline with documentation gaps and architectural context

- **Agent 4: Test Coverage & Validation Analysis**: Examine test coverage and validation approaches
  - Focus: Test strategies, coverage metrics, validation patterns, quality assurance

  - Focus: Alternative solutions, technology comparisons, trade-off analysis, migration paths
  - Tools: Technology research, comparison analysis, migration assessment, trade-off evaluation
  - Output: Technology options with comparative analysis and migration considerations

- **Agent 8: Risk Assessment & Future-Proofing Analysis**: Evaluate risks and future-proofing considerations
  - Focus: Risk factors, future trends, technology longevity, support ecosystem
  - Tools: Risk analysis, future trend assessment, ecosystem evaluation, sustainability analysis
  - Output: Risk assessment with future-proofing recommendations and mitigation strategies

**Sub-Agent Coordination:**

- Each agent saves findings to `/tmp/investigation-agents-$SESSION_ID/`
- Parallel execution provides 7-9x speed improvement over sequential research
- Cross-agent correlation provides comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis
- Results synthesized into cohesive investigation report with confidence scoring

ELSE (simple investigations):

Execute sequential codebase analysis:

- Search existing implementations: rg "$ARGUMENTS" --type-add 'code:*.{rs,go,java,ts,js,py}' -t code
- Find related configuration: rg "$ARGUMENTS" --type yaml --type json --type toml
- Look for documentation: fd "README|ARCHITECTURE|DESIGN" --type f | xargs rg -l "$ARGUMENTS"

STEP 3: Pattern Discovery and Architecture Analysis

TRY:

- Find implementation patterns: rg "impl._$ARGUMENTS|class.*$ARGUMENTS|interface._$ARGUMENTS" -A 5 -B 2
- Analyze dependencies: rg "$ARGUMENTS" package.json Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml requirements.txt
- Check test coverage: fd "test|spec" --type f | xargs rg -l "$ARGUMENTS"
- Document architectural relationships and data flows

CATCH (pattern_not_found):

- Note absence of existing implementations
- Document opportunity for greenfield implementation
- Focus investigation on industry best practices

STEP 4: Web Research and Technology Comparison

Execute comprehensive web research:

- Search for "$ARGUMENTS best practices 2025"
- Find benchmark comparisons and case studies
- Review GitHub trends and community adoption
- Check Stack Overflow for recent solutions and common issues
- Analyze Reddit discussions for real-world experiences

STEP 5: Solution Synthesis and Evaluation

Apply evaluation framework:

- Technical criteria: performance, scalability, security, maintenance
- Project fit: stack alignment, team expertise, migration complexity
- Future-proofing: maturity, community support, corporate backing
- Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment

STEP 6: Recommendation Formulation and State Management

Generate structured investigation report with:

- Executive summary with key findings
- Current state analysis from codebase exploration
- Options evaluation with pros/cons for each approach
- Final recommendation with implementation strategy
- Risk mitigation strategies and next steps

STEP 7: State Management and Session Cleanup

TRY:

- Update session state: /tmp/investigate-state-$SESSION_ID.json
- Save investigation results for future reference
- Create checkpoint for resumable investigations
- Generate summary statistics and insights

CATCH (investigation_incomplete):

- Save partial results to state file
- Document areas requiring additional research
- Create resumption instructions for next session
- Mark investigation as pending completion

FINALLY:

- Clean up temporary files: /tmp/investigate-temp-$SESSION_ID-*
- Archive investigation artifacts if requested
- Update session metrics and completion status
